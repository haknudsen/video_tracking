We can do sales videos, web videos, and even Kickstarter videos, all at a competitive price. With our custom video presentations, conveying your message and promoting your brand has never been more effective!</p><h3>Video Presentations vs. Slides</h3><p>Here’s an important thing to consider: Different people absorb information at different rates and in different ways. There are those who learn better through the use of sound or by having someone explain the details to them, while others absorb information better when they are able to see a visual for it. These days, the use of video presentations to get ideas across quicker and more effectively is becoming the trend. </p><p>Slide presentations tend to get boring over time. Imagine sitting through a presentation where you’re basically made to read through paragraphs of text—completely disregarding the visual advantage that this medium presents. These days, people pay attention better if you give them something interesting to look at; this is where video presentations come in. Unlike slides, it is not limited in explaining key points. Because you have a speaker, the audience’s attention is immediately drawn to it.</p><p>This is what we can provide you with: custom videos as a PowerPoint alternative. After all, nobody wants to read a long line of text when a video can explain your point in 15 seconds or fewer. Aside from that, website visitors do not stay on a page for a long time. If you cannot catch their attention within the first few seconds of their visit, they would immediately close the window or switch to a different website.</p><div style="width: 100%;max-width:1280px;margin:0 auto;padding:1rem">  <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">	  <a href="http://www.talkingheads.com/">  <img src="http://seovideoexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/wp_image_duplicator_uploads/Professional Website Presenter.jpg" alt="Some of our Website Spokespeople"/></a> </div></div><h3>In Brief: The Benefits</h3><p>Our custom video presentations, can transform your 500 word pitch into something shorter, something more eye-catching.
